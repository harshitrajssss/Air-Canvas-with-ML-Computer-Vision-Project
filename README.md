# Air-Canvas-with-ML-Computer-Vision-Project
Developed an interactive Air Canvas project using OpenCV and Mediapipe, enabling users to draw in the air by tracking hand gestures. The system detects hand landmarks and translates finger movements into drawable points on a virtual canvas. Built in Python, leveraging OpenCV for image processing and Mediapipe for precise hand tracking.
